 I'm currently a PhD candidate in <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu/">Physics at the University of Maryland, College Park</a> (UMD). I mainly work in the groups of <a href="https://walsworth.umd.edu/">Ronald Walsworth</a> of UMD, <a href="https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/rajendran/">Surjeet Rajendran</a> of Johns Hopkins University, and <a href="https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/xingang-chen">Xingang Chen</a> of Harvard University.

<strong>Research interests:</strong> Iâ€™m interested in <font style="color:FireBrick" >precision measurement tests of fundamental physics</font>. I work at the intersection of particle physics, quantum physics, astrophysics and cosmology to uncover novel methods of searching for new physics. The Standard Model of particle physics and Big Bang cosmology are two stunningly successful pillars of our modern understanding of the universe. They successfully describe phenomena ranging from sub-nuclear distances to the size of the universe. Despite these stunning successes, they do not comprise a complete theory of nature, as they fail to account for astronomical and cosmological observations that establish the existence of <font style="color:FireBrick" >dark matter and dark energy</font>. In my research, I seek to understand the nature of these dark components of the universe. I am also interested in understanding the physics of the <font style="color:FireBrick" >pre-Big Bang universe</font>.
