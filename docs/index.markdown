 I'm currently a PhD candidate of <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu/">Physics at University of Maryland, College Park</a> (UMD).  I am interested in both theoretical and experimental aspects of fundamental physics.

<!--  <strong>Research interests:</strong> The Standard Model of particle physics successfully describes phenomena ranging from sub-nuclear distances to the size of the universe. It has also withstood every direct experimental probe. Despite these stunning successes, it is not a complete theory of nature, as it fails to account for astronomical and cosmological observations that establish the existence of dark matter and dark energy. Therefore, a pressing puzzle in modern physics is what is the nature of  <strong>dark matter </strong> as well as dark energy? Hot Big Bang cosmology is another breathtakingly successful theory that explains a wide range of cosmological observations. The Big Bang cosmology indicates that the universe began as a soup of Standard Model particles that expanded and cooled to become the structure we see today. A curious mind then may ask: what is the working physics of the  <strong>pre-Big Bang universe </strong>, and what are its components and dynamics that prepare such a hot soup?! -->
